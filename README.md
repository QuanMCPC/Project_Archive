Where I'll put my failed project here

All of the failed project is released under `MIT license`

Splitted file will have a name start with `SPLITTED_` and all of the splitted file is split by a program called: FFSJ ([http://www.fastfilejoiner.com/](http://www.fastfilejoiner.com/)) (Copyright Â© Le Minh Hoang.), and you can also join the file using the same program.

Also, I'M NOT THE ONE who created the program btw.
